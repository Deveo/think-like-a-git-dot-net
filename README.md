This is the source I use to generate [think-like-a-git.net](http://think-like-a-git.net/).

Once I wrote and launched the site, I've been extremely lax about coming back and writing any sort of updates.  So I thought that maybe, if I put it up on GitHub, people might want to send me pull requests, and that would prompt me to pay a little more attention to the site.

We'll see...

UPDATE 2015-10-01:  ...yeah, not so much.  Sometime in the past few years, the 'webby' gem that I originally used to write the site stopped working on my machine.  It might be nice to port the site to Middleman, but that's a fair bit of work that I never seem to find the time to do.
